    <string name="about_content">First and foremost I want to thank you for downloading my app and taking the time to read this. I designed this app to give people who care for each other a new way to express this through a few unique ways. This consists of changing the ringtone / photo / name on your contact and also the ability to send greetings cards. Another unique feature to the app is the ability to record your voice and send this to your loved one either as is or convert it to a chipmunks voice to give it some humour. I hope that everyone enjoys using the app and I sincerely hope this bring you closer to those you love and care for. Please ask your friends and family to download and enjoy.\n\nRegards:\nKaveek Maghraj Jimmy </string>
